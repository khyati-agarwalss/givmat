# givmat
"giv" is short for GIVE and "mat" is a Hindi word which means VOTE

Voting in a country is one of the most important right to ensure fair representation and equal voice when making decisions.
However, there are many issues such as corruption and lack of transparency which discourage many people from accessing this right at all.

"givmat" is an online voting application which will ensure the authenticity of every vote, along with making the complete process transparent for every citizen of the country. 

# How does "givmat" work?
As soon as givmat determines that someone is eligible to vote, the person would receive a token or key that would allow them to vote exactly once.

The plus point is: the whole voting process would be decentralized, which means that there is no central agency which must be trusted to conduct the elections fairly and securely. 

Any registered citizen can participate and become a node in the system which will collectively ensure that the system is available throughout the duration of the election, and that the votes are counted correctly.

"givmat", with the help of distributed ledger system, votes could be verified right after the voting is finished, so that officials can be certain that the votes are counted correctly and there are no security breaches at risk.

"givmat" will provide full transparency by eliminating the need for central authorities to be involved. Technology can be potentially the answer to the question of how to keep elections and voting as secure and foolproof as possible.
